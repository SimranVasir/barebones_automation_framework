-----------------------Guide for setting up the project---------------------------

1. Install cucumber for Java plugin

1. If you cannot navigate from .feature files to step definition files.
        a. Check if you have the Substeps plugin in IntelliJ. If yes, uninstall it since Cucumber for java plugin does not work along with Substeps plugin
        b. Go to Settings -> Editor -> File Types -> Cucumber Scenario. Then add "*.feature" to the registered patterns
        c. If everthing worked, Intellij will recognize the feature files and there will be a green icon beside the feature files names in project directory
